By all means, as someone who works in the banking industry, Near should not have been able to get ahold of the Deathnote from that safe
deposit box without anyone knowing. The bank only has one of the keys. They do NOT keep a copy of the other. It'd be possible for the
police to get in, but they'd have to DRILL in. No way anyone would have fallen for that.

All in all, the ending of that show was wildly disappointing. After--spoiler alert--L was killed, the show really went downhill. No one liked
Near. He was not a well written character.
